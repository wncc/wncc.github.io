'Say,What's on your Mind' is an application to post facebook updates via voice.

I have integrated the Google Speech to Text API with the Facebook Android API to directly post the voice messages to the current logged in user's profile.

The voice message can also be altered by user.

After posting the message,user will be redirected to the recent voice message posted on the facebook application.

Future Plans:
------------
1. Posting on friend's / group wall.This can be done by fetching the user's profile information.
2. Multi Platform Updates can be incorporated.Twitter API can also be linked to tweet the voice message.
3. Dictionary based mechanism to extract keywords to enhance the message.Example - If the message contains "Feeling Happy" or "Feeling Wonderful", we can update the message to add smiley(as done on facebook currently).If possible,similar approach can be used for check-ins as well.
